    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My Education started at Victoria public school, which is unfortunately shut down now. Followed by A.V.Graham public school until grade 8, at which point I moved on to Tecumseh vista academy for high school, where I completed pre secondary schooling. Post secondary, I attended Adult upgrade courses at both St. Clair College and the Mason Education Centre. Mason Education Centre was particularly helpful in upgrading my skills.</p>
