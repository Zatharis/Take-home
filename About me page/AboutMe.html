    <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>My Education started at <strong>Victoria public school</strong>, which is unfortunately shut down now. Followed by <strong>A.V.Graham public school</strong> until grade 8, at which point I moved on to <strong>Tecumseh vista academy</strong> for high school, where I completed pre secondary schooling. Post secondary, I attended Adult upgrade courses at both <strong>St. Clair College</strong> and the <strong>Mason Education Centre</strong>. Mason Education Centre was particularly helpful in upgrading my skills.</p>

            <h2>Home town</h2>
            <p>I don't have much information about my home town. The town's name is <strong>Tecumseh</strong>, and I live near <strong>Lacasse Park</strong> which is a small park but it is nice to walk around. and often go to <strong>fred's big chief</strong> for mechanics and gas. The station used to be owned by <strong>Dave</strong> who was a great mechanic and is retired now.</p>

            <p>I don't really feel comfortable talking about my family more than what was mentioned on the first website about me. I apologize</p>
